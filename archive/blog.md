## 26.01.2020: Beta 2 - Proof-of-Time miner
Third way to mine - Proof-of-Time! <br>
It's a super-new concept (someone has to make breakthroughs in the crypto world, just like we did with Arduino miner...) so please report if there are problems and what would you all improve :) <br>
Also, today is my birthday so happy bday to myself :P <br>
Download Beta 2 here: [releases/tag/beta-2](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/tag/beta-2)

## 2.12.2019: Network back up online and version 0.6.7 released!
What more to say, the network is working and there's Alpha 6.7 which includes automatic server search. <br>
Download it here: [releases/tag/alpha-6.7](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/tag/alpha-6.7)

***

## 16.11.2019: Network offline

Duino Coin network will be offline until serveo will come back online (they need to fix some phishing issues). <br>
Serveo dev declares that after it will be fixed it should work stable then. <br>
As an apology to this inconvinience, every user that was active in the last 2 weeks will receive 5 DUCO. <br>

***

## 10.11.2019: Version 0.6.5 released!
Colored PC Miner, re-designed Wallet and much more in Alpha 6.5! <br>
More info here: [releases/tag/alpha-6.5](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/tag/alpha-6.5)

***

## 9.11.2019: Backup pool
Serveo declared inaccessibility for a few days, so here's a *crude* backup server: <br>
* Pool address: **0.tcp.ngrok.io** 
* Pool port: **14005** <br>

Wallet will not work, because it's hard-coded to serveo, but you can use miners. <br>
Delete `MinerConfing_0.6.5` file and then you will be able to re-run the setup with entering pool address and port.

***

## 2.11.2019: Pool is back online
Finally! Serveo and our pool is back up and running again.

***

## 2.11.2019: Backup pool
DUE TO SERVEO STILL BEING OFFLINE, WE'VE BOOTED UP **BACKUP POOL SERVER.**<br>
Wallet will not work, because it's hard-coded to serveo, but you can use miners. <br>
Point them to: 
* Pool address: **0.tcp.ngrok.io**
* Pool port: **13966** <br>

Delete `MinerConfing_0.6.4` file and then you will be able to re-run the setup with entering pool address and port.

***

## 2.11.2019: Pool offline - serveo.net down (again)
Serveo is down, we can't do anything about it. 

***

## 1.11.2019: Bitcoin Forum thread
We've finally made a bitcointalk topic! Read the conversation here: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5197656.msg52942015#msg52942015](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5197656.msg52942015#msg52942015)

***

Changelog and download links here: [releases/tag/alpha-6.4](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/tag/alpha-6.4)

***

## 22.10.2019: End of outage - pool back online
After a 4 hour inaccessibility, **serveo.net is back online and thus our pool.**

***

## 22.10.2019: Possible temporary connection problems
**Serveo.net is down** - Duino-Coin pool will be not accessible until serveo developers will fix the problem. <br>
Sorry for inconvenience, but we can't do anything about it.

***

## 20.10.2019: Plans for 0.6.4
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/634115103037325313/635391774030037004/Screenshot_20191020-101953.png?width=300&height=600) <br>
Do you have something you'd like to see in future release? <br>
Let's talk about it at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kvBkccy)! <br>

~~Versions **0.6.2** and/or **0.6.3** will be released in a few hours. <br>
**Happy mining!**

***

## 16.10.2019: Status update
Welcome back Duino-Miners! Long time no see, huh? <br>
Main reason I created this post is that now we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kvBkccy)! <br>
Come and talk with us, we will also try to solve any issues with Duino-Coin :) <br>
Other than that, Duino-Coin is now so popular that we went from 400 to 670 difficulty in less than two weeks! <br>
We have 46 registered users and many of them are active daily. <br>
It's hard to say how thankful I am that you guys are still staying with us!

***

## 3.10.2019: 400 diff reached!
Hello! Today we've reached difficulty 400! <br>
![400 difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/7epbuPp.png)
![400 difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/mtZoS5D.png) <br>
Yeah, that's a lot of diff 400 in one blog post.

## 2.10.2019: Alpha 6.1 released: registration bug fixed
Today I've released Alpha 6.1. It fixes a bug in the Wallet that caused registration problems. It also contains new miner that includes some performance and "UI" tweaks. There still may be some bugs left, but at least registration and logging-in works.
### [Download Alpha 6.1 here](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/tag/alpha-6.1)
### [Pool statistics website](https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-statistics/)

***

## 2.10.2019: Warning: registration bug
Wallet registration is broken: registration dialog doesn't appear. <br>
Logging-in still works though. **Everything will be fixed ASAP! Sorry for problems!**

*** 

## 1.10.2019: Why it's the best time to mine Duino-Coins
**Some theoretical news today.** <br>
I'd like to share with you why now is the best time to buy/mine duino-coins:
1 DUCO is roughly 0.1 XMG, so 10 DUCO is 1 XMG.
Using official pool, at let's say 400 difficulty, at current block reward, mining one DUCO using **low-end** PC takes no more than 30 minutes.
So, in the worst-case scenario mining 10 DUCO - 1 XMG will take 5 hours. <br>
With the ever-changing price of altcoins, in one day you should be ale to mine $0.14. That's **$4,3/month in the worst case scenario.** <br>
Mining the same amount of $ but by mining XMG in the best case scenario would take you at least 2,5 months on the same setup. <br>
Good to know fact is that you can exchange **any** amount of DUCO - no minimal payout/depost like on other half-crefible sites. <br>
So, these are mine thoughts on DUCO mining profitability. Hope you enjoyed these numbers :) <br>
**Mine while you can!**

***

## 27.09.2019: Pool statistics website
Hello! Pool statistics website is now ready! <br>
Maybe you'll be able to see your nickname on it! :) <br>
It is updated every 120 seconds, so give it some time if you're not seeing youself.
### [Visit Duino-Coin Statistics website](https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-statistics/)

## 22.09.2019: 300 diff reached!
Hello again! Today we've reached difficulty 300! <br>
![300 difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/lyfU5Pf.png)

***

## 22.09.2019: Repository clean-up
Hello Miners! <br>
To make GitHub repo more visually appealing, I've made: <br>

* separate branch for GitHub pages
* separate folder for community-made miners
* fixed typos in README
* other small visual changes not worth describing :P
* not Git related, but changed some visuals in PC Miner (v0.6.2)

Statistics website will be in the works soon. <br>
We still need to fix some things with the server. <br>
Also I'd like to mention user **ironmanmp** - he already mined **over 30 Duino-Coins!** Good work - literally! <br>
That's it for now. Stay tuned for more!

***

## 13.09.2019: Alpha 6 released
Hello everyone! <br>
As you might've noticed, we were doing many changes in past few days. <br>
That's because we are working on a pool statistics website! <br>
New Alpha 6 server now has built-in API so it will be easier for us to get and display these statistics. <br>
Other than that, you now can find *Exchange* button in Wallet, along with some fixes. <br>
Arduino and PC Miners have also received some minor improvements.
### [Download Alpha 6](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/tag/alpha-6)

## 9.09.2019: 30 registered users and 100 diff reached!
Hooray! Today we've reached 100 difficulty on official pool. <br>
![100 difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/jWuwQ5E.png) <br>
Also, Duino-Coin network has reached over 30 registered users! <br>
**Welcome everyone :)!**

## 6.09.2019: Register to receive signup bonus!
For a limited time, newly registered users will now receive 0.5 DUCO just for signing up! <br>
Other than that, block reward has been increased. <br>
Also, alpha 5.2 will be out soon. It contains various bugfixes and other optimizations. <br>

## 2.09.2019: Exchange Duino-Coins to Coin Magi
I'm proud to announce, that you can now experimentally exchange DUCO to XMG! (and the other-way around) <br>
**DUCO Exchange service:** [https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/](https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/) <br>

***

## 30.08.2019: Pool/servers are back online

***

## 29.08.2019: Scheduled pool inaccessibility
Official servers will be offline for a few days as I'm changing some things in software. <br>
Sorry for this! <br>

***

## 25.08.2019: Alpha 5.1 - Small update
In today's new release I've fixed a bug between Miner and Wallet. <br>
It doesn't break compatibility with older version, so if everything's working fine for you, **you can stay on Alpha 5.** <br>

***

## 25.08.2019: Plans for next release
Hello! In this blog post I'm going to present some future features (probably for next release?). <br>
Firstly, I'll make a few YouTube videos to spread the word about DUCO. <br>
GUI Wallet will be receive a bit better UI, mainly some tweaks in existing design. <br>
When I'll get my hands on ESP8266 or NodeMCU Wifi boards, I'll think about ability for them to mine without need of a computer. <br>
In plans I also have making a GUI Miner (but much later, it's not very needed). <br>
That's it for today. Cheers!

***

## 22.08.2019: ALPHA 5 IS OUT!!!
**SHA1 IMPLEMENTATION, GUI WALLET, NEW MINER, NEW ARDUINO MINER - ALL OF THIS IN [NEW RELEASE](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases)!** <br>
Many new, exciting, fresh stuff today! Everything I spoke about in previous posts is now ready to use! <br>
What are you waiting for? Download all-new Arduino Miner and start mining those Duino-Coins! :smile:

***

## 20.08.2019: Quick info
Server has received a few bugfixes and optimalization changes (thanks, MrKris7100!) <br>
PC Miner (AutoIT and Python) - also done. <br>
GUI Wallet - 1/3 done. <br>
Arduino code - I haven't started working at it yet. <br>

***

## 19.08.2019: SHA1 Server and miner done!!!
SHA1 Algorithm is now fully working and implemented.<br>
**Everything thanks to MrKris7100!** <br>
Things left to do: Wallet, some Miner changes and Arduino code. <br>
Servers will be back online in a few days, as soon as everything's ready. <br>

***

## 18.08.2019: Planned (temporary) server inaccessibility
Due to many changes, official servers will be offline for a few days.<br>
We need to fix and change many things so this may take some time. <br>
When we'll be done, you will be notified by a new release, blog post and readme file changes. <br>

***

## 17.08.2019: Quick status update
Welcome back! <br>
Sorry for inactivity, I was on a little vacation. <br>
**Proper SHA1 algorithm is almost done** (see previous post). <br>
Official servers were offline for I think ~2 days, sorry for that. Now they're up and running. <br>

***

## 14.08.2019: Better algorithm in the works
Hi everyone! <br>
Thanks to MrKris7100 SHA1 implementation is now worked on! <br>
Big beer for him! See ya'll later in the next update. <br>

***

## 13.08.2019: 10 registered users
Welcome back! <br>
Duino-Coin network has now 10 registered users! <br>
Pretty exciting, isn't it? <br>

***

## 12.08.2019: New reward system
Hi duino miners! <br>
Today a new release is out! <br>
Featuring new reward system. **Here's how it works:** <br>
Miner sends his current work to the server. <br>
Server hashes the result and compares it with result submitted by miner. <br>
If they're equal, a new, higher, standard payout is added to the account. <br>
If result's aren't the same or miner hasn't submitted his work, very low or zero payout is made (invalid share). <br>
This way, I kept (partial) compatibilty with older miners and softly pushed new algorithm. <br>
<br>
Also, server update: now shares cannot be submitted faster than 150ms (each). This prevents attacks and invalid share spam. <br>
**That's it for today! Happy mining!**

*** 

## 12.08.2019: Webpage
Hi everyone! <br>
I've decided to create a GitHub Page. <br>
Here I'll describe latest updates about duino-coins.
